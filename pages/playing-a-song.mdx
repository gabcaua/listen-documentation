# Play a song or playlist

<Callout type="info">
  Listen can only play _some_ audio files and downloadable, copyright-free,
  SoundCloud links.\
  Listen can't play videos. Instead, Listen will smartly
  search for a similar audio on SoundCloud and play it.
</Callout>

    ### Use the <span style={{color: "green"}}>`/play`</span> command
    There are two ways to run the `play` command:
    <Tabs items={['Natural Language', 'Slash Command']}>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            You can ask Listen to add a song to the queue in your name by sending **`Listen play`** + the name of the song you want to play in a text channel. Example: **`Listen, play`** `Why we Lose - Cartoon (NCS)`
            <Callout type="info">
            To keep Listen's understanding of human, natural language, consider [donating](https://patreon.com/iamcaua).
            </Callout>
        </Tabs.Tab>
        <Tabs.Tab>
            <Callout type="info">
            Simply use the slash command **`/play`** and follow the instructions in the menu.
