# Solving audio playback problems

As an audio player bot, Listen has to consistently maintain real-time audio frames every second.\
**Region, audio effects, volume** and other settings can all affect the playback frames quality.

  This article is not a complete solution, but it's a good starting point.

## Diagnosing the problem

<Steps>
### Access Listen's industry-leading performance tool
Type **`/listen` `performance`**\
This command provides useful information and statistics about performance.\
To continue the troubleshooting process, follow the **<span style={{color: "green"}}>tutorial</span>** carefully.

**Here you can check if the problem is on our end.**\
This will help us diagnose the problem faster.

### Finding the problem

To find the problem, we will check for the values highlighted in <span style={{color: "blue"}}>**` code blocks `**</span>

Here's a list of values that can help us diagnose the problem:

 **Values that influence the general user experience**

 - **Main socket:** A number that represents how many milliseconds Listen takes to communicate with the Discord Gateway API. **The lower the better.**
 - **Execution time:** A number that represents how many milliseconds Listen takes to execute commands.\
 **The lower the better.**
 - **Memory usage:** A number that represents how much memory Listen uses. **No impact whatsover.**

 **Values about the RTC (Real-Time Connection) between Listen, Discord and you** 

 - **Latency:** A number that represents how many milliseconds Listen takes to communicate with her own Remote Audio Servers (Powered by [Lavalink](https://lavalink.dev/) technology). **The lower the better.**
 - **Destination:** Exposes the audio destination, indicating the region the voice channel is in (example `brazil001.discord.media`). **Near to you is better.**

 **Values from the Remote Audio Server attached to your voice channel**

 These values are only available if you are connected to a voice channel.\
 They will help us diagnose the problem faster.\
 We will check for signs of **stress** or **high load**.

#### RTC Debugging
 - **Sent frames** indicate how many **healthy** audio frames have been sent to the server, example `2.970 [99.00%]`. It maxes out to 3.000 (100%). **Higher is better.**
 - **Lost or accelerated frames** indicate how many audio frames have been lost or accelerated. **Lower is better.**
 <Callout type="info">
 High **lost or accelerated frames** is a sign of stress caused from **audio effects** and **volume**.
 </Callout>
#### Processing load
 - **RTC Playback** indicate how much CPU load the server is needing to process audio. **Lower is better.**
 <Callout type="info">
 High **processing load** is a clear sign of stress caused from the decoding of multiple **unoptimized** audio formats (like .mp3 and .aac) concurrently. This affects the playback of files uploaded by users.
 </Callout>
#### Remote player memory
 - **Allocated** and **Used** indicate how much memory Listen is using. **Higher is better.**
 <Callout type="info">
 High **Used** is a sign of stress caused from **multiple players**.
 </Callout>
#### Existing voice sessions
 - Reveals how many servers are attached to this node. **Lower is better.**

### Solving the problem

After checking the problem, you can try **disabling some audio filters** and **setting the volume filter to 100%** will reduce lost or accelerated audio frames. You can also change the Region of your voice channel, or use a different voice channel.


### Checking if the problem is on your end

If it still doesn't help, you might need to **reconnect** to your voice channel or free up some resources in your device, such as **CPU**, as it is responsible for real time audio processing and latency.

Sometimes, if a processor is not powerful enough to process audio, it will lose audio frames more often as Listen's buffer is emitted in a 200 milliseconds interval.

Also, your network's latency may be too high to support seamless, lag-free and real-time Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) connections.
